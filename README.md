### What I learned

Hereâ€™s a summary of what I learned while building the Mood Tracker app:

#### User Authentication:
I successfully implemented authentication features such as registration, login, and profile management using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure communication between the client and the server.

#### Mood Tracking:
I used Redux for state management, handling the user's mood entries and ensuring smooth updates between the frontend and backend.

#### Responsive Design:
By utilizing Tailwind CSS, I created a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the app looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Data Visualization:
I integrated **Chart.js** to display mood trends over time, allowing users to visualize their mood data in an engaging and interactive way.

#### Security:
I implemented **secure authentication** with password hashing and token-based authentication to protect user data.
